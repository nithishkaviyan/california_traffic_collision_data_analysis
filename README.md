# california_traffic_collision_data_analysis

This repo contains notebook used to analyze California Traffic collision data. Here are some of the questions I am trying to answer right now:

*  On what days are pedestrians involved in collisions?
*  Are DUIs more likely on certain days?
*  How has COVID19 changed collisions? Are different types of vehicles involved? At different times?
*  What type/color of car/motorcycle is involved in the most crashes?
*  Can we predict injuries based on the other variables in a collision?
*  Are their more accidents around sunrise/sunset?



Data source: The data is taken from the following link in kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/alexgude/california-traffic-collision-data-from-switrs
